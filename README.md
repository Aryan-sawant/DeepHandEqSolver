# DeepHandEqSolver

Welcome to DeepHandEqSolver, a deep learning-based project for recognizing and solving handwritten mathematical expressions.

## Getting Started

1. Download the `DeepHandEqSolver.ipynb` file and the dataset.
2. Extract the dataset.
3. Upload the notebook to Google Colab and set the runtime to GPU.
4. Upload the dataset to Google Drive for fast uploading to Colab.
5. Run the notebook cells. 
   - The first cell will prompt you to sign in to Google Drive to mount the dataset.
   - Copy the path of the folder named "Handwritten Math Dataset".
   - Execute all cells.
   - The second last cell will generate a tunnel website IP address as a password.
   - In the output of the last cell, click on the last link.
   - Paste the generated password and submit.
   - Upload images of math expressions and click on "Predict" in the Streamlit app.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Streamlit

## Dataset

The dataset should include images of handwritten mathematical expressions.
